Modified LEACH Simulator

What is it?
-----------

LEACH is a Sensor Nework Algorithm.
 
 / LEACH info here /

My Algorithm is an improvement over LEACH. It gives us much higher network
lifetimes and also results in slower deaths of the nodes resulting in
higher number of nodes capable of transmitting in each successive rounds.
